<h1>A Fault Diagnosis Toolbox for Dynamic Systems in Matlab</h1>

<p>
  Fault Diagnosis Toolbox is a Matlab toolbox for analysis and design of fault
  diagnosis systems for dynamic systems, primarily described by differential equations.
  In particular, the toolbox is focused on techniques that utilize structural analysis,
  i.e., methods that analyze and utilize the model structure. The model structure is
  the interconnecitons of model variables and is often described as a bi-partite graph
  or an incidence matrix.
</p>

Key features of the toolbox are:
<ul>
  <li> Finding overdetermined sets of equations (MSO sets), which are minimal
    submodels that can be used to design fault detectors</li>
  <li> Diagnosability analysis - analyze a given model to determine which
    faults that can be detected and which faults that can be isolated</li>
  <li> Sensor placement - determine minimal sets of sensors needed to be able
    to detect and isolate faults</li>
  <li> Code generation (C++ and Matlab) for residual generators. Two different
    types of residual generators are supported, sequential residual generators
    based on a matching in the model structure graph, and observer based
    residual generators.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The toolbox relies on the object-oriented functionality of the Matlab
language and is freely available under a MIT license.
