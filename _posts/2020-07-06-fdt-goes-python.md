The toolbox has been ported to Python and can now be easily pip installed. Functionality is, with only a few minor exceptions, the same as in the Matlab toolbox. Currently, there are no separate python documentation, but have a look at the [python introduction tutorial](/tutorial/python-intro/) and then you should be on your way.

## Installation
The package are uploaded to the Python Package Index at [https://pypi.org/project/faultdiagnosistoolbox/](https://pypi.org/project/faultdiagnosistoolbox/) and the installation procedure is as easy as
```bash
pip install faultdiagnosistoolbox
```
The toolbox requires Python 3.6 or newer and works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. The toolbox includes compiled C++ source, so if you do not have a suitable compiler environment installed, make sure you get a pre-compiled installation. If there are any issues with installation on your system, please contact Erik Frisk.
