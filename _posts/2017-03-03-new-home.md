The fault diagnosis toolbox now has a new home at GitHub Pages.

Due to the reorganization of the IT resources at the university, I have decided
to move the homepage of the fault diagnosis toolbox to GitHub and utilize Github Pages
and Jekyll. For the site, I borrowed more than one note on how to handle tutorials
from the excellent project [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) (hope Johan doesn't mind).
