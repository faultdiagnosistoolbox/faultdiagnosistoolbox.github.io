I have finally put the source code for the Python version publically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/faultdiagnosistoolbox/pyfaultdiagnosistoolbox) and there is also basic documentation and examples at [readthedocs](https://faultdiagnosistoolbox.readthedocs.io/).

Please let me know if there are any issues.
