It is now final that me and Mattias Krysander will arrange a pre-congress tutorial
at the IFAC World Congress in Toulouse, France.


If enough people register, me and Mattias Krysander will arrange a tutorial at
the IFAC World Congress in July 2017. The tutorial will be a full-day tutorial,
extending the Safeprocess tutorial with mainly some new theoretical developments
and hands-on Matlab exercises and tutorials in Matlab for those participants who want.
