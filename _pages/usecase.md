# Introduction
<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine.jpg" width="45%" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"/>
The air-path of an automotive gasoline engine is important for
understanding how much fuel to inject, how to keep combustion emissions low,
protect exhaust catalysts, and optimize efficiency. This system is not only
industrially relevant, it is also an interesting system for academic basic
research due to its complexity, its highly interconnected subsystems due to turbocharging, and
challenging to model accurately. The model used here is based on a control oriented model of the air-path
consisting of pressure dynamics that describe flows and thermodynamic relations to
describe temperatures and heat flows. The model has 94 equations and
14 states. The model is highly non-linear, has
external, mapped, functions implemented as lookup-tables, and hybrid
mode-switching statements (if-statements).

The measurements/control outputs used, in total 10, are: pressure sensors
(throttle, intake manifold, ambient), temperature sensors (throttle, ambient),
intake air mass flow, engine speed, throttle position, waste-gate position, and
commanded amount of injected fuel. The considered faults, in total 11, are:
Clogging of the air filter, leakages (before compressor, after throttle,
before intercooler), stuck intake valve, increased turbine friction,
sensors (throttle position, air mass flow, intake manifold pressure,
pressure before throttle, temperature before throttle)

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_cycle.png" width="55%" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/>
Measurement data is obtained in an engine test cell at [Vehicular Systems](http://www.fs.isy.liu.se/).
The engine, a standard production engine, is equipped with a development control system
and subjected to load conditions corresponding to a car driving the EPA Highway Fuel Economy Test Cycle.
Engine operation is thus transient, although not violently so, and correct handling
of dynamic engine behavior in the diagnosis system is essential. The objective is then to,
during normal operation, detect and isolate the faults with a given false alarm probability and
optimize detection performance.

# Modelling

The model is a differential-algebraic (DAE) model, based on the model
developed in Eriksson, L. (2007). _[Modeling and control of turbocharged SI and
DI engines](https://doi.org/10.2516/ogst:2007042)_. Oil & Gas Science and
Technology - Rev. IFP, 62(4), 523â€“538.

The model-object is created by a statement
{% highlight matlab %}
  m = DiagnosisModel( modelDef )
{% endhighlight %}
where the struct modelDef is a model definition containing the fields

* `modelDef.x` - cell array of names of unknown variables
* `modelDef.f` - cell array of names of fault variables
* `modelDef.z` - cell array of names of known variables
* `modelDef.parameters` - cell array of parameter names
* `modelDef.rels` - cell array with model equations

In addition, the model relations/equations are written directly as
symbolic expressions. For example, a restriction model using an
external function `W_af_fun`, a control volume with a mass
state `m_im` and a temperature state `T_im`, and a
measurement equation for the air mass flow `W_af` can be written
as
{% highlight matlab %}
%% Declare model equations
modelDef.rels = {
   ...
   % Air filter restriction:                                                
   W_af == W_af_fun(p_amb,p_af,plin_af,
      H_af,T_amb)+fp_af

   % Control volume intake manifold:
   p_im == m_im*R_air*T_im/V_im                                     
   dmdt_im == (W_th - W_ac) + fw_th
   dTdt_im == (W_th*cv_air*(T_imcr-T_im)+R_air*
      (T_imcr*W_th-T_im*W_ac))/(m_im*cv_air)

   % Measurement signals:
   y_W_af == W_af + fyw_af % Air mass flow
   ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
The toolbox supports only structural models, but here models with symbolic
model equations is used since the objective of the use case is to go
from model to generating code for residual generators and then expressions
for the model equations are needed. When the `modelDef` structure has been defined and
the `model` object has been created it is time to explore the
model. Basic model information is obtained using the `Lint` class method
{% highlight matlab %}
>> model.Lint()
Model: Engine model

  Type: Symbolic, dynamic

  Variables and equations
    90 unknown variables
    10 known variables
    11 fault variables
    94 equations, including 14 differential
      constraints

  Degree of redundancy: 4
  Degree of redundancy of MTES set: 1

  Model validation finished with 0 errors and
  0 warnings.
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_model.png" width="65%" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"/>
The model structure, i.e., which variables that appear in which constraints, are
extensively used by the methods implemented in the toolbox. This model structure
is automatically inferred from the model equations and the `PlotModel` class method can
be used to visualize the model structure. It shows the equations on the vertical axis
and the variables on the horizontal axis. A dot represent that a
variable appears in the corresponding equation. Blue, red, and black
dots represent unknown, fault, and known variables respectively.

{% highlight matlab %}
>> model.PlotModel()
{% endhighlight %}

# Diagnosability Analysis

Now, with a defined model there are many diagnosis analyses that can be performed
on the model structure only. For example, it is possible to find out if the model
contains enough redundancy to detect and isolate faults, i.e., answer diagnosability
questions like
> Can I detect this fault?

or

> Can I isolate this fault from that fault?

or

> What isolation performance is possible using only direct application of state-observers?

Such non-trivial questions can be answered using structural techniques giving best-case
results.

<a name="diaganalysis_canonical"/>
## Canonical decomposition

A key tool in structural analysis for fault diagnosis is the
[Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition](http://cms.math.ca/10.4153/CJM-1958-052-0).
To plot the decomposition, extended with fault variables and equivalence classes
as described in [(Krysander and Frisk, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2003968),
is computed using the `PlotDM` class method
{% highlight matlab %}
  model.PlotDM('eqclass', true, 'fault', true)
{% endhighlight %}
which results in the plot

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_dm_canonical.png" width="75%" align="centering"/>

It is a Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition with
an additional canonical decomposition of the overdetermined part. The
overdetermined part is marked with a blue rectangle and faults
entering in equations contained in the overdetermined part are
structurally detectable. The set of equations in the overdetermined
part is partitioned into equivalence classes,
indicated by gray shaded rectangles in the figure, with the property
that all faults appearing in the same equivalence class is not
structurally isolable from each other.

<a name="diaganalysis_fi"/>
## Fault Isolability Matrices

Although the canonical form is informative, it contains
a lot of details. Another form of illustrating single fault
isolability performance is the _isolability matrix_ computed using
the class method `IsolabilityAnalysis` as
{% highlight matlab %}
model.IsolabilityAnalysis()
{% endhighlight %}
<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_isol.png" width="50%" align="right"  hspace="10" vspace="5"/>
A dot in position _(i,j)_ indicates fault _j_ will be a diagnosis if
fault _i_ is the present fault. Thus a diagonal matrix represents full
single fault isolability, i.e., all single faults are uniquely
structurally isolable in the engine model.

Low structural index is an interesting class of models since, for
example, for low-index models established techniques like
state-observers and Extended Kalman Filters can be directly applied
while this is not true for high-index models.
The isolability of faults when only using low-index approaches can be computed by
{% highlight matlab %}
model.IsolabilityAnalysis('causality','int')
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_isol_int.png" width="50%" align="left"  hspace="10" vspace="5"/>
The isolability matrix shows how the fault isolability performance
degrades, which is expected, if the residual generation techniques are
limited to pure integration based methods. These isolability matrices gives a
direct way to early evaluate possible isolation performance of the model
and with the given measurements. Of course, these are structural results meaning
that even if the isolability matrix indicate that all faults are uniquely
isolable, it is not certain that this is realizable in the real application with
a required detection and false-alarm probabilities. But is gives an important
first indication on what is possible.

<a name="resgenanalysisdesign"/>
# Residual Generator Analysis and Design

One successful approach to residual generation is to find testable
sub-models and then, based on such sub-models, design residual
generators. The first step is then to make a complete search for
testable sub-models, here [Minimally Structurally Overdetermined (MSO)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2007.909555)
set of equations. This step is based only on the
structure of the model and in the engine model there are 4496 MSO
sets. This means that, even with redundancy degree of only 4, there
are several thousand different sub-models that can be tested
independently. In the software, to compute the set of MSO sets use the
`MSO` class method as
{% highlight matlab %}
msos = model.MSO();
{% endhighlight %}
The output `msos` is a cell array of index vectors to equations in the model.
It is possible to compute the isolability of all MSO sets as
{% highlight matlab %}
model.IsolabilityAnalysisArrs( msos )
{% endhighlight %}
that is equal to the isolability matrix computed earlier.

<a name="resgenanalysisdesign_index"/>
## Low-index and observability properties of sub-models

The toolbox supports sequential residual generator design and for models
with high differential-index such direct residual design is not always
appropriate since numerical differentiation of measurement
signals are needed. The structural differential-index can be
determined by efficient structural algorithms and the MSO sets with
low-index can be found using the `IsLowIndex` class method as
{% highlight matlab %}
lowidx=cellfun( @(m) model.IsLowIndex(m), msos )
{% endhighlight %}

For the engine model there are 206 low-index MSO sets out of the 4496.
Performing the call
{% highlight matlab %}
model.IsolabilityAnalysisArrs( msos(lowidx) )
{% endhighlight %}
will give the isolability properties of the low-index MSO sets previously
computed; the isolability matrix with integral causality.

If a state-observer technique is to be used, observability of the
sub-models is of importance. Structural observability can easily be
checked, for all MSO sets, with the class method `IsObservable` as
{% highlight matlab %}
obs=cellfun( @(m) model.IsObservable(m), msos )
{% endhighlight %}
In the engine model, all MSO sets are structurally observable.

<a name="resgenanalysisdesign_seq"/>
## Sequential residual generation

There are many ways to design a residual generator based on a model
with redundancy. Sequential residual generation is one direct and
simple way, especially if the model is of low differential index. An
MSO set have exactly one more equation than the number of unknown
variables and this means that if one equation is used as the residual
equation, the remaining equations will form an exactly determined
system of equations. Then, the exactly determined set of equations is
solved for all unknown variables numerically on-line and insertion of
all computed variables in the residual equation then produces a
residual. For the engine model there were 4496 different MSO sets and
previous analysis gives that there exists 206 low-index
sub-models. From these 206 sub-models the toolbox can automatically
generate a large number, here 728, of candidate residual generators
with integral causality. Using the `IsLowIndex` class method, it
is concluded that MSO number 1650 with its 74:th equation as a
residual equation constitute a low-index problem. A matching, i.e.,
computational path for the exactly determined model is found using the
class method `Matching` and then the method `SeqResGen`
can be used to generate Matlab or C-code.
{% highlight matlab %}
M = msos{1650}; % Set of equations
r = M(74); % Redundant equation
M0 = setdiff(M,r); % Exactly determined part
Gamma = model.Matching(M0); % Compute matching
model.SeqResGen( Gamma, r, 'ResGen_1650_74', 'language', 'C'); % Generate code
mex ResGen_1650_74.cc % Compile
{% endhighlight %}
This generates an object code that can be called directly from Matlab
with measurement data and model parameters as inputs and the residual
as output. Next step is to evaluate generated code for a set of such residuals
on measurement data.

<a name="testcelleval"/>
# Evaluation on Test Cell Measurements

To illustrate performance on measurement data we consider only 4 of
the 11 faults; faults in the air-flow sensor `fy_waf`, the intake
manifold pressure sensor `fyp_im`, the intercooler pressure
sensor `fyp_ic`, and the intercooler temperature sensor
`fyT_ic`. Measurement data were collected for the fault free and
4 faulty cases, then in total 5 data sets, during a 12 minute long EPA highway
fuel economy test cycle. Sample measurements from the fault free case are

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_NF_data.png" width="90%"/>

Out of the 728 residuals only a few is needed for isolating between
the 4 faults and using a data-driven test selection procedure not
described here, 7 residuals were in the end chosen for this
illustration. Using class methods `FSM` and
`IsolabilityAnalysisArrs`, the fault signature matrix and the
isolability matrix of the selected 7 residuals are
<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_ts_FSM_isol.png" width="60%" align="right"  hspace="10" vspace="5"/>
As can be seen, all single faults are structurally isolable.

<a name="testcelleval_run"/>
## Running residual generators
The generated code for the 7 residuals are run on the 5 data sets and
the residuals in the fault free case are shown in the plot below where the dashed
lines correspond to thresholds selected to achieve a 1% false alarm probability.

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_res_NF.png" width="90%"/>

The generated code from last section is run using the single Matlab call
{% highlight matlab %}
r = ResGen_1650_74(z, state_init, params, Ts );  
{% endhighlight %}
where `z` is a matrix with the measurements, the struct `state_init`
gives the initial state, `params` the model parameters, and
`Ts` the sampling time. It takes about 0.55 seconds to evaluate a
residual for 12 minutes of 1kHz sampled data on a 2016 Macbook Pro
which corresponds to about 1500 times faster than real-time.

The residuals for data with a fault in the air-flow sensor are

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_res_fywaf.png" width="90%"/>

<a name="testcelleval_fi"/>
## Fault Isolation Performance
According to the fault signature matrix above, the
red colored residuals should be sensitive to the air-flow sensor fault
but not the blue colored residuals. The fault is present during the
gray shaded intervals, i.e., the fault is injected intermittently. The
blue colored residuals are not sensitive to the fault as expected and
residuals 1, 2, and 5 are above the dashed thresholds when the fault is
present. Residual 3 should be sensitive to this fault but the fault to
noise ratio is apparently too low for this fault, but is selected for
its ability to detect fault `fyp_ic`.

The figure below  shows in blue the distributions of the
residuals in the fault free case and in red the distributions of the
residuals for an air-flow sensor fault. It is clear that residuals 1,
2, and 5 are good at detecting this fault since the residual
distributions change significantly.

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_res_pdf_fywaf.png" width="90%"/>

Given the residuals and thresholds, the consistency based diagnosis candidates
as a function of time, in the case of an air mass-flow sensor fault, are

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_res_isol_fywaf.png" width="90%"/>

In the figure, a 1 means that the fault is a diagnosis and a
0 that it is not. The percentage of time where there is an isolation
error is shown above each plot. Here, no post-processing is performed,
and the error can be improved by post-filtering or applying adaptive
thresholds, maybe at the cost of a delayed detection.
It is clear that the fault isolation reliably indicates the correct
fault `fyw_af` and isolates reliably from `fyp_ic` and
`fyT_ic` but has a little more difficulty isolating from fault
`fyp_im`.

To summarize the performance of the generated diagnosis system, the
confusion matrix is illustrated using a 3D-plot

<img src="/assets/images/engine/engine_res_isol_confusion_3d.png" width="90%"/>

Here, the probability of correct isolation is plotted, and a perfect system
would correspond to a diagonal with probability 1. It is clear from the figure
that faults `fyw_af`, `fyp_ic`, and `fyT_ic` can be reliably isolated. Fault `fyp_im`
however can be reliably detected but is sometimes difficult to isolate from `fyw_af`.
